# ravine

A simple game where you fly a space-ship through a ravine, written for the Vic Dual arcade platform.
The game is built using [8bitworkshop](8bitworkshop.com), an online IDE with a set of emulators for different
8-bit arcade platforms.

This is my first 8-bit game. I used the excellent [Making 8-Bit Arcade Games in C](https://amzn.to/2o8joxk)
as a guide to get me started.
